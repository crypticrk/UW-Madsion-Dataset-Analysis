About the Dataset :

The University of Wisconsin - Madison publishes reports for all courses (and sections of these courses), instructors, subjects, and grade reports for each section for every Fall and Spring semester since 2006.

There are more than 9,000 courses in this dataset. There are nearly 200,000 course sections with grades, with 3 million grades reported in total. 18,000 instructors are included in the dataset, all of whom are associated with various sections that may or may not have grades reported for them.

The data was retrieved from the UW Madison registrar office, and extracted from PDF files using the open source tool, madgrades-extractor.
